  We are three students that attend Wake Tech Community College, and are participating in a Capstone course in collaboration with IBM. Our Capstone course focuses on Blockchain technologies and is based on distinguished IBM engineer, Bob Dill's ZeroToBlockchain series.  
  
  So, what is Blockchain? According to Rebecca Fenter, Blockchain is a technology designed to focus on streamlining the appropriate flow of information in business networks and to ensure that we can share information that should be shared easily and rapidly in a manner that minimizes the amount of time spent finding and correlating information across business networks. It works by encoding a block of digital data for each transaction that occurs and is agreed upon by all parties on its details. Each block is connected to the previous block and the following block in order to create an irreversible and immutable chain of individual, connected blocks. This allows the blocks to be unable to be altered or inserted out of the order of the events. For our course, we started by learning about Bob Dill's ZeroToBlokchain series. We followed his videos and set up our development environment and a Blockchain that focused on the transactions between a Buyer, Seller, Provider, Shipper and Finance Company. After we successfully tested Bob's Blockchain, we moved on to developing our own Blockchain.
  
  For our Blockchain Capstone project, we were given the prompt of creating a Registration Blockchain. In our project, we are detailing the transactions between a Student, Registrar and a Cashier. The student starts off by entering the courses (s)he wants to take.
